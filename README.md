# The Gamers Forum

The Gamers Forum is a website for gamers of all creeds (console, PC or mobile) to discuss all things video gaming. The website is divided up into different gaming related topics, under which posts can be created and users can also then reply to any post that they would like to either add to or express an opinion on. Only registered users are able to add posts or replies. There is also a contact form should a user need to send a message to admin for whatever reason.
